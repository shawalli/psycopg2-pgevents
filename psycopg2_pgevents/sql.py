    Parameters
    ----------
    connection: psycopg2.extensions.connection
        Active connection to a PostGreSQL database.
    statement: str
        PGSQL statement to run against the database.

    -------
    response: list or None
        List of tuples, where each tuple represents a formatted line of response from the database engine, where
        each tuple item roughly corresponds to a column. For instance, while a raw SELECT response might include
        the table headers, psycopg2 returns only the rows that matched. If no response was given, None is returned.
